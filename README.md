## EDA on Iris Dataset

### Project Overview

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Iris dataset** using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

The goal of this EDA was to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships among the various features of the dataset (sepal and petal measurements across three iris species - as a part of CodeClause Internship.

### Dataset Used

* **Dataset Name:** Iris Dataset
* **Source:** Built-in dataset from Seaborn
* **Samples:** 150
* **Features:**

  * Sepal Length (cm)
  * Sepal Width (cm)
  * Petal Length (cm)
  * Petal Width (cm)
  * Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

### Key Objectives

* Load and inspect the Iris dataset
* Perform basic statistical analysis
* Visualize feature distributions and relationships
* Understand species-level differences
* Generate insights for feature relevance

---

### Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab
* Jupyter Notebook

---

### Visualizations Included

* Histogram distributions for features
* Boxplots grouped by species
* Scatterplots for pairwise relationships
* Correlation heatmap
* Pairplot for multivariate analysis

---

### Key Insights

* Petal length and width show the most separation across species
* Setosa is clearly distinguishable from the other species
* Sepal measurements have some overlap but still add value
* No missing values or anomalies detected
