## EDA on Iris Dataset – CodeClause Internship

### Project Overview

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Iris dataset** using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It was completed as part of the **CodeClause Data Science Internship (August 2025)**.

The goal of this EDA was to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships among the various features of the dataset (sepal and petal measurements across three iris species).

### Dataset Used

* **Dataset Name:** Iris Dataset
* **Source:** Built-in dataset from Seaborn
* **Samples:** 150
* **Features:**

  * Sepal Length (cm)
  * Sepal Width (cm)
  * Petal Length (cm)
  * Petal Width (cm)
  * Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

### Key Objectives

* Load and inspect the Iris dataset
* Perform basic statistical analysis
* Visualize feature distributions and relationships
* Understand species-level differences
* Generate insights for feature relevance

---

### Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab
* Jupyter Notebook

---

### Visualizations Included

* Histogram distributions for features
* Boxplots grouped by species
* Scatterplots for pairwise relationships
* Correlation heatmap
* Pairplot for multivariate analysis

---

### Key Insights

* Petal length and width show the most separation across species
* Setosa is clearly distinguishable from the other species
* Sepal measurements have some overlap but still add value
* No missing values or anomalies detected
